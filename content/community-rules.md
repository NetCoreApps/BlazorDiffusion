## Community Rules

BlazorDiffusion is where anyone is welcome to discover the amazing world of Stable Diffusion.
We want to keep it a welcome place, so we have created this ruleset to help guide the content posted on BlazorDiffusion. 

If you see a post or comment that breaks the rules, we welcome you to report it to the our moderators.

These rules apply to all community aspects on BlazorDiffusion: all parts of a public post (title, description, tags, visual content), comments, links, and messages. 
Moderators consider context and intent while enforcing the community rules. 

- No nudity or sexually explicit content.
- Provocative, inflammatory, unsettling, or suggestive content should be marked as Mature.
- No hate speech, abuse, or harassment.
- No content that condones illegal or violent activity.
- No gore or shock content.
- No posting personal information.

### Good Sharing Practices

Considering these tips when sharing with the BlazorDiffusion community will help ensure you're contributing great content.

#### 1. Value
  - Good sharing means posting content which brings value to the community. Content which opens up a discussion, shares something new and unique, or has a deeper story to tell beyond the image itself is content that generally brings value. Ask yourself first: is this something I would be interested in seeing on Imgur if someone else posted it?
#### 2. Transparency
  - We expect that the original poster (OP) will be explicit about if and how they are connected to the content they are posting. Trying to hide that relationship, or not explaining it well to others, is a common feature of bad sharing.
#### 3. Respect
  - Good sharing means knowing when the community has spoken through upvotes and downvotes and respecting that. You should avoid constantly reposting content to User Submitted that gets downvoted. This kind of spamming annoys the community, and it won't make your posts any more popular.
Repeated violations of the good sharing practices after warning may result in account ban.


If content breaks these community rules, it will be removed and the original poster warned about the removal.
Warnings will expire. If multiple submissions break the rules in a short time frame, warnings will accumulate, which could lead to a 24-hour suspension, and further, a ban. 

If you aren't sure if your post fits the community rules, please don't post it.
Just because you've seen a rule-breaking image posted somewhere else on BlazorDiffusion doesn't mean it's okay for you to repost it.
